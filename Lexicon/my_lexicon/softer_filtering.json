Judas is his human alter ego, his undercover agent in the world. These Gnostics equated Ialdabaoth with the Hebrew Yahweh, whom they saw as a jealous and wrathful deity and an opponent of the supreme God whom Jesus came to earth to reveal.Whoever wrote the Gospel of Judas was a harsh critic of mainstream Christianity and its rituals. Because Judas is a demon working for Ialdabaoth, the author believed, when Judas sacrifices Jesus he does so to the demons, not to the supreme God.

In a similar way the \"dude\" of the day becomes androgynous; and the result in one case is a masculine soul in a woman's shape, and in the other a feminine soul in the degraded form of the so-called \"dude\".",

We consider both women and men who exhibit dude-like qualities to be \"dudes,\" and assert that the word \"dude\" can mean many different things depending on the context."

The killer, or virama, participates in some common constructions that would be clumsy to handle the way they would be in the other Indic scripts, so the control function of the virama is separated from the diacritic function of the killer. The virama, 0F4D is used to form conjunct consonants, while the killer, 0F52, is a simple diacritic and has no effect on character shaping. The killer is also combined with the VOWEL SIGN O (0F4B) to form the low level tone vowel “o.” When used this way, this symbol is known as hyei hto, or “thrust forward.”",

Doyle, that it will take half a billion dollars to overcome the present housing shortage, is probably not an exaggerated presentation of the plight New York is in in this respect. Furthermore, the housing-shortage conditions of New York reflect, proportionately, the conditions prevalent in almost every large city in the country. We seem to be threatened with widespread houselessness and homelessness, for the pitiable makeshifts to which so many are driven by house shortage, and the consequent exorbitant rents, are appalling travesties of what American homes should be. Just what Mr. Walter Stabler, Comptroller of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, meant when he said that \"unless radical action is taken something drastic will happen,\" is not quite clear. \"Something drastic\" is a pretty vague term. Mr. Stabler could hardly mean riotous invasions of the premises of the \"ins\" by infuriated mobs of the \"outs.\" Houselessness is undoubtedly a breeder of lawlessness, but it is not open to direct-action remedies of the bread riot variety which sheer hunger not infrequently precipitates. If people have not a place to lay their heads at night, not because they are penniless but because there are no roofs to shelter them, about the only thing they can do is to camp in parks and suburban fields. It has even come to that in Newark, and it may come to that elsewhere unless there is relief of some sort.",
