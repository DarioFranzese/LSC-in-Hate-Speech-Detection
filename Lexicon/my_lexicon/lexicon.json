The virama, 0F4D is used to form conjunct consonants, while the killer, 0F52, is a simple diacritic and has no effect on character shaping. The killer is also combined with the VOWEL SIGN O (0F4B) to form the low level tone vowel \u201co.\u201d When used this way, this symbol is known as hyei hto, or \u201cthrust forward.\u201d",
                    "2002; For example, although the \u2018vowel killer\u2019 diacritic may be called a \u2018pulli\u2019 in Tamil, it is still referred to by the Unicode character names as a \u2018virama\u2019.",
                    "2002; Thai words that have been borrowed from Sanskrit, Pali and English usually try to retain as much of the original spelling as possible; as this will often produce pronunciations that are impossible or misleading, a \u2018killer\u2019 symbol is placed above the redundant consonant to indicate that it may be ignored",
                    "2002; Sometimes the \u2018killer\u2019 sign, called kaaran in Thai, cancels out not only the consonant above which it appears, but also the one immediately preceding it."
