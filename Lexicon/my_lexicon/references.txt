Postprocessing: joining all lexicons removing duplicates (case unsensitive), kept word/expressions with
more than two definitions provided by the Wiktionary API, result is stored at "full_hate_lexicon.txt".
Removed plurals as well. Removed words which definitions were all negatively tagged. Removed words with 30+ definitions collected (except for drag)
Next step is filtering again keeping only the words which plural meanings are not only hateful.
