## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

This repository is currently **a work in progress** and is primarily intended to **keep track of my research work** during my thesis.  
The structure may appear **disorganized**, and not all files or scripts are production-ready.  

However, since a **significant amount of datasets and resources** have already been collected, I decided to make the repository **public** during the development phase, so that these resources can be **easily accessed and referenced** by others.

## 🧩 Project Overview  

This repository hosts the research work carried out during my master's thesis internship at IRIT (Toulouse).  
The main goal of the project is to **study the phenomenon of Lexical Semantic Change (LSC)** in the context of **Hate Speech Detection**.  

Lexical Semantic Change refers to the way in which the meaning and usage of words evolve over time. In social media and online communication, this phenomenon plays a crucial role in how hate speech emerges and adapts. Understanding such changes can help in designing more robust and temporally aware hate speech detection systems.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- **Analyze** how lexical meaning shifts impact the performance of Hate Speech Detection models.  
- **Collect and curate datasets** suitable for studying LSC in social and online contexts.
- **Build new resources to complete the task** such as new structured datasets and lexicons (work in progress...)  
- **Explore novel approaches** for modeling and detecting LSC within hate speech data (to be done)

## 🧪 Current Progress (as of October 2025)  

- ✅ **Datasets collected** from relevant sources and previous research (references available in this repository).  
- 🔍 **Ongoing:** Analysis of lexical extraction and generation methods for identifying key terms and semantic shifts.  
- 🚧 **Next steps:**  
  - Build a structured dataset for the LSC task in hate speech detection.  
  - Experiment with new methods for capturing and quantifying semantic shifts.
